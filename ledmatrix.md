For an arcade and console systems theme with LED matrix display, here are some ideas that could work well at 16px by 64px:

    Classic Game Characters -
        Pac-Man: A sequence showing Pac-Man eating dots or being chased by ghosts.
        Mario: Mario running, jumping over a Goomba or collecting coins.

    Prompt: 'Pixel art of Pac-Man chasing or being chased by a ghost, designed for an LED matrix in 16px by 64px'

    Gaming Icons -
        Controller: An 8-bit style game controller with buttons lighting up.
        Joystick: A retro joystick with movement direction.

    Game Over or Score Screens -
        Game Over: With pixelated text and perhaps a skull or a character dying.
        High Score: A scoreboard with pixel numbers changing.

    Simple Animations -
